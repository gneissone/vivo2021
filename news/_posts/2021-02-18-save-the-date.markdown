#### Save the date! for the 11th annual VIVO conference!

Dear VIVO community,

We are happy to announce that the 12th VIVO conference will be held online from June 23 to 25, 2021.

Due to the pandemic situation, the VIVO Project is organizing a free, virtual event and weâ€™ll be inviting everyone in the global VIVO community to participate.

More details are coming soon, and the VIVO conference website will be updated with information in the coming days.

Looking forward to your participation,

The VIVO conference task force.
